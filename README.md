# Linux Server Configuration

## Project for Fullstack Web Development at [Udacity.com](http://udacity.com)
This project is about setting up a Linux server to host a web application using
a previously completed project. The original source code that will be used for
this project can be found here: [catalog-project]
(https://github.com/junclemente/catalog_project).

An Ubuntu Linux server instance will be setup on [Amazon Lightsail](http://lighsail.aws.amazon.com)
and secured by configuring the Uncomplicated Firewall (UFW).
Apache server and Postgres database will also be installed and setup to run a
Flask application.
